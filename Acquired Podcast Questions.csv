Where did Brad Gerstner grow up?,"Brad: I grew up in a small rural town in northern Indiana near Notre Dame, first generation college. My dad had a classic immigrant story. His parents had kind of given up everything in order to help put their only child through college. He started at Northwestern, they couldn't afford to finish there, ended up at Bradley in Illinois, got an engineering degree.",
What was Activision Blizzard's revenue for 2016?,"David: Yeah. So to wrap it up, in yearend 2016, at the end of last year, just Blizzard within Activision Blizzard did $2.4 billion in revenue, which by the way was up from 1.6 in 2015, so the growth is insane.",Activision Blizzard
Who founded Blizzard?,"So Blizzard was started initially as a company called Silicon & Synapse by three college friends from UCLA right after they graduated in 1991, they had all studied computer science together: Allan Adham, Frank Pearce, and Mike Morhaime. They love video games and they wanted to get into the scene and they decided kind of “hey, rather than working for someone else, this industry is young, let’s start a company.” And so they did and they started out at first not actually making their own games because they just graduated from college, they really didn’t know what they were doing. They started porting other people’s games from platform to platform. Like one of the big titles that they ported was Battle Chess. I kind of vaguely remember this and they ported that version onto the Commodore 64, and that both led them to make some money as a baby startup but also got them experience with game development and they got kind of access to these code bases of what games look like.",Activision Blizzard
What person from what company leads a Latin American VC fund?,"Now onto our presenting sponsor for all of these specials, the SoftBank Latin America Fund. We have a very special guest you've heard from Shu, Paulo, and the CEOs of unicorns in the portfolio like Rappi, Quinto Andar, and Banco Inter. Today we are joined by Marcelo Claure, the COO of SoftBank Group and the CEO of SoftBank International, where he leads the Latin America Fund. Welcome, Marcelo.",7 Powers with Hamilton Helmer
Who gave Hamilton Helmer a job at McKinsey?,"Hamilton: Yeah. That was their only office at the time and they were growing like stink. So I had this funny experience where I had nine interviews of an hour each. There was a quite a lot of skepticism, kind of an egghead, doesn't have an MBA.

Finally, my last interview was with Bill Bain. I sat down in his office and I thought, you know, I'm really interested in what he's doing. I spent the entire interview asking him about how he got it started, what was his entrepreneurial experience, which always has fascinated me.

David: I forget the name of the folks who founded McKinsey, but they created a whole market. They're entrepreneurs.

Hamilton: Yeah. McKinsey goes back further, and then BCG came in as sort of a strategy focus, and then Bain spun out of BCG. Then Bill looks at his watch and he says, oh, our hour is up. I've got to go and I realized, oh my God. I haven't said anything about myself. You idiot, Hamilton.

So we're literally walking towards the door. He's shaking my hand and I said, oh, Mr. Bain, I'm sure I can do the work here. I'm really interested and it's fine. Everybody is worried about me not having an MBA, but that's just not a problem. I'm sure I can do it. He said, oh, I don't have an MBA either.

David: Great.",7 Powers with Hamilton Helmer
Is there math in the Seven Powers book?,"Hamilton: I'll just end with a funny anecdote, which is, there's a question of whether I put any math in the book at all to speak of, and then the end, I put it in the appendix so that you don't have to read it, but it is there. The reason I use it is just for precision of logic. It makes things very clear exactly what you're talking about.",7 Powers with Hamilton Helmer
Why does 10-K choose to post on Twitter on Saturday mornings?,"10-K: I posted my first thread on a Saturday morning. I don’t remember if it was a Saturday morning or a Friday morning of a long weekend. It might have been Friday but it was a long weekend, so Friday, Saturday, and Sunday were off. Inside that is basically that if you’re going to be posting not about the daily news, not something that is time sensitive, if you’re going to be posting about a general investing concept, you’ll get down to people’s feeds early in the weekend.",10-K Diver_ Building a Top Fintwit Account and Teaching Finance Principles to Everyone (Pseudonymously_)
How do Acquired Sessions podcasts differ from regular episodes?,"Ben: This is your baby. What is Acquired Sessions?

David: Acquired Sessions is normally on the show, we are so scripted.

Jason: Yeah, you are.

David: We have a great time. We do four-hour episodes. It's awesome. But really, for folks like you who we know really well, what happens if we throw out the script and we just chop it up?",ACQ Sessions_ Jason Calacanis
What percentage of Airbnb hosts are outside the United States?,"Unlike other companies that we've covered recently—yesterday, like DoorDash—this is truly a global company with 86% of hosts outside of the United States.",Airbnb
How did Airbnb utilize Craigslist in its early growth strategy?,,Airbnb
What was the growth rate of Airbnb's bookings in 2017?,"2017, booking growth slows to 50% from over 70% the year before... 2018, bookings growth slows to 40%... 2019, the growth slows to less than 30%.",Airbnb
What changes did Airbnb undergo in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?,"David: Airbnb, of course, realizes this. In May of this year—shortly after the start of COVID and after raising this emergency capital—they have layoffs. They lay-off 25% of the company. That’s a significant reduction in force. They cut $800 million in marketing expenses. There you go—addressing each of those two points you just made, Ben.",Airbnb
How does Airbnb's business model compare to Amazon and eBay?,"Airbnb is not Amazon. They are much more like eBay, and eBay has been on a similar path, enormous TAM, global network effect, torrid growth for many years, but then it slowed.",Airbnb
 What was the impact of Tim O'Reilly's influence on Jeff Bezos and Amazon's direction?,"David: In the early days of all this—I think it was early 2002—Tim O'Reilly flies up to Seattle and meets with Jeff Bezos. The reason he wants to come see Jeff, they've had a checkered history in the past. O'Reilly has not always been the biggest fan of Amazon. He's a book publisher, obviously, so he has some feelings. He wants to make the pitch to Jeff that Amazon should embrace Web 2.0 and transform amazon.com into a participatory website.",Amazon Web Services
Why was Netflix's adoption of AWS significant?,"Ben: I don't know about 100%, but yes, they're still an enormous customer. Reed Hastings was actually the very first guest interviewed on stage at the first re:Invent in 2012.

David: I think in that interview, if it wasn't that one, it's another one around that time, he talks about people say, Reed, you compete with amazon.com, aren't you worried about being on AWS? And he's like, no. I'm not worried at all about being on AWS. It is legitimately the smart infrastructure decision for us to make.

Ben: That was such a feather in Amazon's cap. They've had two big feathers in their cap, there's that one and the CIA one. It's secure enough for the CIA to use, so it should be secure enough for you, and that was a few years later.

The Netflix one, a lot of people were afraid to use AWS early on because they felt like they didn't want to do business with Amazon if they were a retailer, or they didn't want to do business with Amazon if they were in video, or in any of these things that Amazon was competing on. Reed getting up on stage and saying this matter of factly and so forcefully was him saying, you can trust that AWS is different than Amazon.",Amazon Web Services
What are the targeted gross and operating margins for AWS?,"Amazon targeted gross margins and operating margins for AWS in the 20%–40% range OR Ben: Yeah, let's start with power, because I think AWS is actually one of the best case studies in power of all time. A longtime listener to the show knows power is what enables a business to achieve persistent differential returns, or put another way to become more profitable than their closest competitor, and do so sustainably, so they can build enterprise value and be sustainably more profitable than their nearest competitor. David, when AWS broke out their financials, they were at, did you say 19%? 18%, 19% operating margins?

David: 19%.

Ben: Now they're at 30%. They've gotten more profitable when the landscape got more competitive.",Amazon Web Services
What was Google's approach to the cloud market?,"Google is sort of counter positioned against NVIDIA here, where they're saying, we want to differentiate Google Cloud with this offering that depending on your workload, it might be much cheaper for you to use TPUs with us than for you to use NVIDIA hardware with us or anyone else. They're probably willing to eat margin on that in order to grow Google Cloud's share in the cloud market",Nvidia Part II_ The Machine Learning Company (2006-2022)
What was the original idea behind The Everything Store?,The idea was that you could use the Internet to build a whole new intermediary layer between consumers and manufacturers that would bypass traditional retailers.,Amazon.com
What was Jeff Bezos' career background before Amazon?,"Ben: Bezos didn't just steal from other retailers. The other thing about Jeff is he comes from a finance background, whereas a lot of the classic retailers come from a merchandising background or an operations background.

David: Certainly, internet entrepreneurs, very few came from a finance background. OR David: Probably arguably for longer than that until recent times. In 1988, he leaves Fitel (the startup) and he goes to work actually in banking. I believe, almost surely, I don't know for sure, but I can't imagine he's not doing quantitative trading in finance. He's a technical guy. He's a computer science graduate. He had been working in this network operations for early stage quant finance",Amazon.com
Why did Jeff Bezos choose Seattle for Amazon's HQ?,"David: Jeff finds out and reads about this. He's like, oh, no, we cannot base this company in California. Not New York, not Texas, probably not Florida. What is the Venn diagram of close to a book distributor, has access to technical talent, and enough technical people I can hire but not so much that I'm cutting out a huge swath of my market? Seattle is the obvious choice.

Ben: Which you wouldn't pick today because of this self-perpetuating thing. Because of Amazon and the ecosystem that they and Microsoft would jointly create here, Seattle's population has been going crazy, especially with people with unbelievably high disposable income. You would not want to—in this day and age—execute this strategy and make that decision about Washington state. But Jeff Bezos hadn't created Amazon yet, therefore, it was a perfect place.

What was Marc Andreessen's initial job status while working on Mosaic?,"Ben: Wow. It's worth pointing out too that when you say this non-traditional background, you alluded to him as this wunderkind, and that was just not true yet. At this point in history, and we have Brian McCullough from the Internet History Podcast to thank for this. I binged the first 10 episodes of that podcast to prep for this. But he brings up the point that Marc was like an hourly worker at NCSA.",Andreessen Horowitz Part I
What was the original name of Netscape Communications Corporation ,"They have a brainstorming session where they're thinking of other ideas for stuff to do and eventually, Marc is like, okay, you know this Mosaic thing? I did build that and all my buddies that I did it with back in Illinois, they're about to graduate too or they have already graduated. We can just go hire all of them, recreate it, and commercialize it. Jim's like, okay, fine. Let's do it. They incorporate and they start the world-renowned, going to be history-making, Mosaic Communications Corporation to commercialize Mosaic.

Ben: I love that they were like, yeah, we'll just use the same name. We'll name our company Mosaic even though that's a thing that's owned by that lab at the university.

David: Obviously, NCSA was not too happy with this. They threatened lawsuits all back and forth. Eventually, they changed the name to Netscape Communications, and that is how it came to be. It was actually Greg Sands who was the first PM that they hired.",Andreessen Horowitz Part I
What was Netscape's market share in web browsers by the time of its IPO?,"David: Yeah, totally. Famously, people at Netscape would talk about how we invented internet time, and that it was this parallel universe that was accelerating faster than reality time. By August 1995, we're just 16 months after the company started.",Andreessen Horowitz Part I
What was the closing market cap of Netscape on its IPO day?,It opens at $75 a share... It closes at $58 a share giving the company a $3 billion market cap.,Andreessen Horowitz Part I
What kicked off the dot-com bubble and led to valuation inflation in the tech industry?,"Ben: It's worth saying a few things. One, this absolutely kicked off the dot-com bubble. This was the moment that it started. There were a couple of internet IPOs before this, but this is the one that blew the doors wide open, made valuations not matter, and created 4 1/2 years of absolute madness from this point forward. But Netscape had an unbelievable growth trajectory, not just in users, but in revenue. In the Ben Horowitz corner of the business, revenues were doubling every quarter, which means they were 16X-ing revenue year over year.",Andreessen Horowitz Part I
How did Microsoft react to the rise of Netscape and the Internet?,"David: Pre-DOJ, which happens because of all of this. In May of that year, Bill Gates saw this happening. He saw Netscape, he saw where this was going to go. In May of ‘95, he had written the internal internet tidal wave memo.

Ben: For anybody who hasn't read that, it is just worth reading in its entirety to understand 1) the genius of Bill Gates, but 2) to understand the context of that time. Even Bill Gates, even Microsoft who was so steeped in this stuff, their strategy was the information superhighway. They were long all this stuff—interactive TV—but they just like most other people did not predict that this low-end disruptor— the internet—based on text being sent over HTTP and images, in line that Marc Andreessen managed to get into the browser too. That that actually was going to be the thing.

It's not until early 1995 when he pens that memo where it becomes obvious even to the smartest, well-positioned people in the whole tech industry to react to this.

David: Once he realizes and writes that memo, oh boy, is it ever game on.

Ben: Guns out.

David: This is a strategic priority, number one of the company. We're going to compete here and we're going to win. It turns out, they actually have the perfect strategy to kill Netscape already in progress within Microsoft. Which is that back in 1994, Thomas Reardon—a famous Microsoft employee and then would go on to be a founder of CTRL-labs, which Facebook acquired a couple of years ago—was playing around. He thought browsers were interesting, this is going to be a thing.

He had licensed for Microsoft some code for a browser from a little company called Spyglass, Inc., which happened to be located in Illinois in Urbana, Champaign. Why was it located in Urbana, Champaign? Because it was the commercial entity started by the university to spin out and commercialize the IP that they developed at the NCSA including the Mosaic web browser.

Microsoft has got a license to the Mosaic web browser. They're like, well, we got this license, we can use it. The terms of the license are actually that we pay Spyglass a portion of the revenues that we make for distributing this thing.

What if we just bundle it to Windows and we give it to everybody for free? Oh my God, stone-cold killers. There actually ends up being a big lawsuit about this. Spyglass sues Microsoft and is like hey, you're giving this away to hundreds of millions of people and you're not paying us anything because you're not charging for it.",Andreessen Horowitz Part I
Who founded Android Inc.?,"October 2003, Android is a startup company, just founded in Palo Alto by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White.",Android
What was the initial target market for Android before focusing on mobile phones?,Android is an operating system company. They want to take Linux and essentially make it into an operating system capable of running on mobile devices. We now know Android runs on so many devices today. The first target market that they’re going to go after is digital cameras.,Android
What was the first Android phone and when was it released?,They end up not shipping the first Android phone until almost a year later in October 2008 and that’s when the HTC Dream slashed in the US the T-Mobile G1 is the first Android phone.,Android
How did Google's acquiring Android change the competitive landscape between Apple and Google?,"David:       Which again, they knew what Apple was up to.

Ben:         Yeah, and they knew they would need a competitive mobile operating system or maybe even actual phones to make sure that they owned that customer relationship to funnel people to search. OR Apple and Microsoft are direct competitors and hate each other, and Google is like this benevolent, hands-off “we serve all” group. And in very short order from 2007 to 2009",Android

What was the original purpose of the website Mt. Gox before it became a Bitcoin exchange?,"Jed McCaleb [...] thought, gosh, these magic cards, they’re super cool. Lots of people love playing. You can buy them on eBay and whatnot. but later there would be a Goat and Reverb. There should be a vertical, specific website on the internet for going, buying, and selling Magic cards. Great, I'm just going to code that up. Why don't we call it Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange, Mt. Gox",Bitcoin
How did Mt. Gox's failure impact Bitcoin?,"By April 2013 [...] Mt. Gox finally starts its death spiral [...] In February 2014, they suspended withdrawals altogether. You can’t take money out of the system at all from Mt. Gox and they file for bankruptcy.",Bitcoin
What was the original business model of Blue Bottle Coffee,"David: No. And James is no exception. Unlike most of the founders we talk about, he is definitely not an engineer. Not even remotely connected with the tech world except for the fact that he lived in the Bay Area. He was a freelance clarinetist, a classical musician who played the clarinet, and he did that for until his mid-30s. Then he kind of woke up one day and he realized, “You know, I’m never going to be the best clarinetist and maybe I should find something else to do with my life.” And what else could he do? Turns out, he had this side hobby of roasting his own coffee beans in his oven at home. So he would buy beans and he would roast them at home in his kitchen in his oven. Apparently made lots of smoke and his wife at the time was not a fan of this hobby. But he made these beans and then he would drink the coffee himself and he would give it to his friends and people loved it, and he thought, “Well, maybe I’ll turn to coffee for my life.”

So he started in the early 2000s, he quits the music world and he lived in -- I don’t know if he actually lived in Oakland or if he started the company in Oakland. He was living in the Bay Area. Starts Blue Bottle in Oakland and the original business plan is that he’s going to keep doing what he’s doing and deliver beans to people’s houses, these great beans that he’s roasted in his kitchen the day before, will deliver them to his friend’s houses. So it kind of sounds like an on-demand startup.

In what year did Rob Meyerson interview Jeff Bezos?,"I interviewed with Jeff Bezos in 2003, in April. After that interview, I left with a very strong feeling that the vision that Jeff had, that if I join the company, I'd have a seat at the table and have a role in building something special, building the company and making decisions. I came in as an individual contributor. Within about three months of joining in about October of 2003, Jeff asked me to lead the company.",Blue Origin and the 2021 Space Landscape (with Rob Meyerson)
What entity acquired booking.com?,"Ben: And we are your hosts. Today, we are covering the 2005 Booking.com acquisition by the Priceline group.",Booking.com with Jetsetter _ Room 77 CEO Drew Patterson
Why didn't Expedia acquire Booking.com?,"David: So the Expedia board looks at all this and says, “We’ve got the golden goose here. We’ve got the best business model.” People say Google is the best business model of all time. “This might be even better. Why would we want to do the agency model?” But in the long run, of course, it’s the agency model that really wins here. What was it about that in the long run that ended up being better?

Drew: So the agency model ultimately was superior in part because it was a better consumer proposition. The merchant model wasn’t so great for the consumer because I had to pay you upfront as opposed to the agency model where I could cancel if I wanted to, I had a lot more flexibility. It also wasn’t so great for the supplier from the standpoint of a hotelier – I don’t really like this merchant model thing where I'm paying you 30%, you have more control over setting price, you’re keeping cash, not me. So that wasn’t great. But again, in fairness to Expedia board, they kind of looked at the world more like we’re in a dominant position, why do we need to move away from this? And I think what they failed to realize was just the size and magnitude of this market and just the power and potential of how quickly this was going to grow. That in combination with what we were talking earlier: the potential for ad words. A really kind of cost effective tool that would allow a business, an online travel agency to scale pretty quickly. And where those things came together was, again, going back to the point we’re making earlier was the longtail because this agency model made it really easy for Booking.com to clean up the longtail very cost effectively and very quickly. It was the much lighter weight approach in contracting, got a lot more hotels on board quickly. They didn’t have to go out and negotiate for net rates with an individual hotel. You can just fill out Geert’s form, send it back and away you go.",Booking.com with Jetsetter _ Room 77 CEO Drew Patterson
What was Vladimir Konstantinovich Magdalin's dream job?,"Vlad: Exactly. The key insight came as following all of these tutorials and trying to find out how people build apps.

I want to work at Pixar, that was the dream job.",Building Webflow_ and the No-Code Movement (with Vlad Magdalin_ Co-Founder and CEO)
What does Charlie Munger think of trading algorithms?,"Andrew: What do you think about the algorithms like Renaissance and stuff like that?

Charlie: Well, of course, Renaissance, the first algorithm was so simple. They sifted all this data for the past and what did they decide? Up, up, which were two closing prices, and down, down were more common than down, up, or up, down.

Once they realized that's the way it was for various reasons deeper than the psychology of man, man is a natural trend follower, he's been gambling short-term, and they just program the computers to automatically buy on one thing on the first up day and sell before the end of the second day. It did it day after day after day. Every day the central clearing agent would say, your check today is $8,500,000. Your check tomorrow is $9,400,000.

What happens is that the easiest trade is to front run, but you know what the average is that the index funds have to buy, and you know what it is exactly. They all know that. The way they get their returns year after year is by taking the leverage, that midday leverage, up higher and higher and higher and higher. They're making smaller and smaller profits off more and more volume, which gives them this big peak leverage risk, which I would not run myself. That's the only way they make these big returns, is to have this huge leverage. It would make you crazy if you were already rich.",Charlie Munger
What has Charlie Munger learned between ages 70 and 99?,"Charlie: I knew when I was 70 that it was hard. It's just so hard. I know how hard it is now. Always, people who are getting this 2 and 20, or 3 and 30, or whatever, they all talk because oh, it was easy. And they get to believing their own bullshit. And of course, it's not very easy. It's very hard.",Charlie Munger
